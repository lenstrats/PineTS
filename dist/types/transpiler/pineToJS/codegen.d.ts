     * Scan the program body for declarations whose names would collide with

     * with a `_$N` suffix.
     *
     * Two collision classes, one rename pass:
     *
     *  1. Pine namespace collisions (NAMESPACE_COLLISION_NAMES — e.g. `fill`,
     *     `size`, `color`, `line`): user variable would shadow the namespace
     *     destructured from `$.pine`. The CALL SITE `fill(...)` is the
     *     namespace, NOT the renamed variable, so callees are NOT renamed —
     *     UNLESS the user declared a FUNCTION with that name
     *     (`position(x) => close + x`, valid Pine): then a bare call
     *     `position(14)` can only be the user function and its callees ARE
     *     renamed (tracked in `userFunctionCollisions`).
     *
     *  2. JS reserved keyword collisions (JS_RESERVED_WORDS — e.g. `delete`,
     *     `super`, `static`): the generated JS would fail to parse
     *     (`function delete()` → "Unexpected keyword 'delete'"). The CALL SITE
     *     `delete(arg)` IS the user function, so callees MUST be renamed.
     *
     * The walker checks the original name's source list at each call site to
     * pick the right behavior.
     *
     * Renaming rules (common):
     * - Variable declaration target (let fill = ...)  → renamed
     * - Function declaration name (function delete()) → renamed (class 2 only)
     * - UDT type name (type new → const new = Type)   → renamed (class 2 only),
     *   together with every type annotation naming it (`new n = ...`,
     *   `array<new>`, field types, `__pineUdtVar` markers)
     * - Assignment target (fill := ...)               → renamed
     * - Bare identifier read (return fill)            → renamed
     * - MemberExpression object (size.tiny)           → NOT renamed (class 1:
     *   a namespace access) / renamed (class 2: `new.new()`, `delete.x` can
     *   only be the user's UDT or variable — no Pine namespace has that name)
     * - MemberExpression property (obj.delete)        → NOT renamed
     * - Object property key ({size: ...})             → NOT renamed
     *
     * Function parameters shadow a renamed global of the same name inside
     * their function: the body is walked with that name removed from the map.
     * Parameters themselves are renamed later, per function, in
     * `generateFunctionDeclaration`.
