 *               at the open price.

 *               shorts), liquidation fills at the extreme itself — the
 *               pessimistic broker model (intra-bar tick order unknown).

 *               already-trimmed) position still breaches at the closing

 * lows. The caller orders the 'extreme' checkpoint BEFORE exit
 * processing on adverse-first bars and AFTER it on favorable-first bars
 * (favorable exits free margin before the adverse extreme is reached).
 *
 * Runs for ALL margin percentages including 100%. At 100% margin the
 * trader still needs full notional collateral; adverse price movement
 * that drops account equity below the position's current notional
 * triggers a margin call. This matches TV's broker-emulator behavior
